			<h2>Designer d'espace</h2>
			<p>Je raconte votre histoire, je valorise vos idées. Je vous accompagne de la conception à la livraison finale du chantier.</p>
			<p>Chaque projet sera étudié en commun, de façon à mettre en valeur les volumes, les matières et les couleurs dans le respect de l’esprit des lieux et le choix adapté des matériaux. Le suivi du chantier sera assuré dans le souci du détail, le respect du planning et du budget.</p>
			<p>En cas de besoin, une équipe pluridisciplinaire peut-être constituée : architecte DPLG, décorateur(trice)</p>

				<h1>It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too.</h1>
<p>Bender, quit destroying the universe! I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop.</p>
<p>If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. Ask her how her day was. Come, Comrade Bender! <strong> We must take to the streets!</strong> <em> Ah, computer dating.</em> It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head.</p>
<h2>Soon enough.</h2>
<p>But I've never been to the moon! Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat. Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!</p>
<ol>
<li>And until then, I can never die?</li><li>Oh right. I forgot about the battle.</li><li>No argument here.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Are you crazy? I can't swallow that.</h3>
<p>We're also Santa Claus! Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."</p>
<ul>
<li>We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!</li><li>If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right.</li><li>Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?</li>
</ul>

<p>I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Pansy. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?</p>
<p>We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.</p>
<p>We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. Then we'll go with that data file! Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! Why would I want to know that?</p>
<p>Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be… It's a T. It goes "tuh".</p>
<p>I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.</p>
<p>Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. It must be wonderful. That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?</p>
<p>Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! It's toe-tappingly tragic! Bender, you risked your life to save me!</p>
<p>Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay!</p>
<p>Why yes! Thanks for noticing. But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!</p>
<p>No, she'll probably make me do it. Why would a robot need to drink? Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!</p>
<p>Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.</p>
